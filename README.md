# 02-Homework - Responsive Portfolio

## Introduction
For our second homework assignment, we were tasked creating and developing our own responsive portfolio online that adjust well to various window and screen sizes. The goal was to get familiar with the features offered by Bootstrap, which allow developers to create responsive layouts easily.

## Motivation

For this assignment, my goal is to learn as much as I can about Bootstrap and use it's features along with everything I've learned about HTML and CSS to build a portfolio that reflects my own development skills as well as personal creativity. I challenged myself to use my own CSS code to override certain Bootstrap CSS attributes in order to create a more personalized website that is still responsive but doesn't have the mass-produced feel that many websites with this framework usually have.

## Version List
### v1.0

## Framework
