# 02-Homework - Responsive Portfolio

## Introduction
For our second homework assignment, we were tasked with creating and developing our own responsive portfolio online that adjusts well to various window and screen sizes. The goal was to get familiar with the features offered by Bootstrap, which allow developers to create responsive layouts easily.

## Motivation

For this assignment, my goal is to learn as much as I can about Bootstrap and use it's features along with everything I've learned about HTML and CSS to build a portfolio that reflects my own development skills as well as personal style. I challenged myself to use Bootstrap components and the built-in grid layout to create a responsive website with elements that adjust automatically across various screen sizes. In the future, I plan on adding my more of my own CSS code in order to personalize the feel of the HTML pages and avoid the mass-produced look that most Bootstrap websites have.
